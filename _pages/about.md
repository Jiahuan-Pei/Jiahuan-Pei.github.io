About me
======
I am a researcher at Dutch national research institute [CWI](https://www.dis.cwi.nl/people/), working on [generative dialogue systems in 
 extended reality (XR) spaces](https://voxreality.eu/).
Formerly, I was an applied scientist at Amazon's A9 team, working on core NLP/IR in Amazon product search.
I have pursued my Ph.D. with the [IRLab](https://irlab.science.uva.nl/) at University of Amsterdam, supervised by [Prof. dr. Maarten de Rijke](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/m.derijke/) and
[Prof. dr. Pengjie Ren](https://pengjieren.github.io/). 
My interest includes natural language processing (dialogue systems, word embedding,
parsing, summarization) and information retrieval (query understanding, recommender system, matcher
embedding).
