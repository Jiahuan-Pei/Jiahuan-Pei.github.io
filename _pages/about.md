About me
======
I am working as an applied scientist at Amazon A9 Search team, based in Berlin, Germany. 
I am working on core NLP/IR in Amazon product search.
Formerly, I
was a Ph.D. from the [IRLab](https://irlab.science.uva.nl/) at University of Amsterdam, supervised by [Prof. dr. Maarten de Rijke](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/m.derijke/) and
[Prof. dr. Pengjie Ren](https://pengjieren.github.io/). 
My interest includes natural language processing (dialogue systems, word embedding,
parsing, summarization) and information retrieval (query understanding, recommender system, matcher
embedding).
