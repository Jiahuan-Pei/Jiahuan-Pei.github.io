In the realm where Natural Language Processing (NLP) intersects with immersive technology, a narrative unfolds. NLP, driving change in digital interactions, has reshaped our virtual landscape. However, the resource-intensive nature of NLP models raises concerns about environmental impact, energy consumption, and scalability. Extended Reality (XR) environments are now integrated with NLP tools, influencing virtual meetings, training simulations, and immersive experiences. The demand is clear: efficiency, optimisation, and seamless fusion of language models to minimise latency and enhance the user experience. The roundtable assembled a group of experts to explore strategies for optimising training pipelines, addressing environmental concerns, and developing sustainable approaches. The focus extended to improving efficiency, reducing latency, and maximising the user experience.
