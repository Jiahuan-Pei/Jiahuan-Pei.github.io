In this talk, drawing from my practical expertise, we will delve into the application of large foundation models and frameworks in natural language processing (NLP) and information retrieval (IR) tasks. Specifically, we will explore recent advancements in multimodal agents within Extended Reality (XR) environments utilizing LLMs such as OpenAI&apos;s GPT models, LLAMA2, etc. We will also discuss model fine-tuning techniques like LORA and QLORA, as well as agent planning methodologies grounded in prompting techniques such as Chain of Thought and ReACT.
