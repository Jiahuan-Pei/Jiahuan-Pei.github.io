Artificial Intelligence (AI) is playing an increasingly vital role in scientific research, particularly in enhancing Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) through the development of smarter agents. Conversational AI agents, in particular, have demonstrated considerable potential in enriching the user experience within multimodal immersive systems, facilitated by large language model (LLM)-powered autonomous agents. 
In this talk, drawing from my practical expertise, we will delve into the application of large foundation models and frameworks in natural language processing (NLP) and information retrieval (IR) tasks. Furthermore, we will address the revision of the frontier research and the potential for fostering interdisciplinary collaborations between researchers and practitioners in the realms of NLP and HCI.
