Artificial Intelligence (AI) is becoming increasingly important for scientific research, with many applications in fields like chemistry and biology. Generative AI, in particular, has shown great promise in accelerating scientific discovery by generating hypotheses and insights that may be difficult for humans to uncover. In this talk, we will use my previous research as examples to explore how generative AI models can be applied to natural language processing (NLP) and information retrieval (IR) tasks. We will also discuss the challenges and limitations of using generative AI, including concerns around uncertainty and interpretability. Furthermore, we will discuss the potential applications of generative AI in scientific discovery, such as accelerating the discovery of new molecules and simulating biological processes. Generative AI also has the potential to facilitate interdisciplinary collaborations between AI researchers and domain experts, such as chemists and biologists.
