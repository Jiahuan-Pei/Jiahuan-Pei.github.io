      "Advancements and Prospects in Dialogue Agents and LLMs\tInvited Talk\tbosch2023\tBosch Center of Artificial Intelligence (BCAI)\t24/07/2023\t\"Renningen, Germany\"\t\t\"In this talk, we will delve into the exciting advancements and prospects within the fields of Dialogue Agents and Language Model Models (LLMs). As the landscape of natural language processing and artificial intelligence continues to rapidly evolve, these two areas play pivotal roles in transforming human-computer interactions and enabling more sophisticated language understanding and generation. The first part provides an encompassing overview of recent research achievements, covering three key areas. Firstly, we explore cooperative dialogue agents, which implement diverse collaboration methods such as model, data, user, and language collaboration. These methods aim to foster more dynamic and context-aware conversational interactions, with significant implications for chatbots, virtual assistants, and other dialogue-based applications in various domains. Secondly, we focus on trustworthy systems, enhanced by uncertainty estimation and faithfulness evaluation, which have garnered increased attention in recent years. Understanding the uncertainty of model predictions and evaluating their faithfulness to the input data are vital for enhancing model trustworthiness, particularly in sensitive and high-stakes applications like medical diagnostics, legal judgments, and industrial decision-making. Lastly, we delve into domain-tailored LLMs, tailored for specific applications such as medical treatment, legal judgment, and industrial assembly. These specialized LLMs offer remarkable potential in providing contextually relevant and precise responses in specific domains, showcasing the power of customized language models. The second part of the talk focuses on exploring promising research prospects, including \"\"Faithfulness / Uncertainty Estimation,\"\" \"\"Multimodal LLMs,\"\" and \"\"LLM Powered Autonomous Agents.\"\" These prospects hold great potential for shaping the future of dialogue systems and language models. Last but not least, I eagerly anticipate your valuable suggestions and insightful questions, as they are highly appreciated and have the potential to enrich the discourse on these fascinating topics.\"\r",

      "Generative AI towards Scientific Discovery\tInvited Talk\tmsr2023\tMicrosoft Research AI4Science\t06/04/2023\t\"Amsterdam, Netherlands\"\t\t\"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is becoming increasingly important for scientific research, with many applications in fields like chemistry and biology. Generative AI, in particular, has shown great promise in accelerating scientific discovery by generating hypotheses and insights that may be difficult for humans to uncover. In this talk, we will use my previous research as examples to explore how generative AI models can be applied to natural language processing (NLP) and information retrieval (IR) tasks. We will also discuss the challenges and limitations of using generative AI, including concerns around uncertainty and interpretability. Furthermore, we will discuss the potential applications of generative AI in scientific discovery, such as accelerating the discovery of new molecules and simulating biological processes. Generative AI also has the potential to facilitate interdisciplinary collaborations between AI researchers and domain experts, such as chemists and biologists.\"\r",

      "Frontiers of Collaborative Task-oriented Dialogue Systems\tInvited Talk\tucl2022\tUniversity College London (UCL)\t06/07/2022\t\"London, UK\"\t\t\"In this talk, I introduce our exploration of collaborative dialogue models and our recent work on task-oriented dialogue systems. Task-oriented dialogue systems (TDSs), as an important branch of dialogue systems, have raised considerable interest due to their broad applicability. Recent end-to-end single-module TDSs have many attractive characteristics, e.g., global optimization and easy adaptation to new domains. However, we think it is impractical to use a single general agent to handle all complex cases in TDSs. For example, an agent that is specialized in booking a restaurant is unlikely to work well in scheduling meetings. Inspired by this intuition, we call for studies on a new series of collaborative task-oriented dialogue system (CTDS) frameworks, where multiple parallel and/or hierarchical agents work in a collaborative manner to achieve better performance than a single, general agent.\"\r",

Understanding the reliability and certainty of transformer model predictions is crucial for building trustable machine learning applications, e.g., medical diagnosis. Although many recent transformer extensions have been proposed, the study of the uncertainty estimation of transformer models is under-explored.
