      "Generative AI towards Scientific Discovery\tInvited Talk\tmsr2023\tMicrosoft Research AI4Science\t06/04/2023\t\"Amsterdam, Netherlands\"\t\t\"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is becoming increasingly important for scientific research, with many applications in fields like chemistry and biology. Generative AI, in particular, has shown great promise in accelerating scientific discovery by generating hypotheses and insights that may be difficult for humans to uncover. In this talk, we will use my previous research as examples to explore how generative AI models can be applied to natural language processing (NLP) and information retrieval (IR) tasks. We will also discuss the challenges and limitations of using generative AI, including concerns around uncertainty and interpretability. Furthermore, we will discuss the potential applications of generative AI in scientific discovery, such as accelerating the discovery of new molecules and simulating biological processes. Generative AI also has the potential to facilitate interdisciplinary collaborations between AI researchers and domain experts, such as chemists and biologists.\"\r",

Task-oriented dialogue systems (TDSs), as an important branch of dialogue systems, have raised considerable interest due to their broad applicability. Recent end-to-end single-module TDSs have many attractive characteristics, e.g., global optimization and easy adaptation to new domains. However, we think it is impractical to use a single general agent to handle all complex cases in TDSs. For example, an agent that is specialized in booking a restaurant is unlikely to work well in scheduling meetings. Inspired by this intuition, we call for studies on a new series of collaborative task-oriented dialogue system (CTDS) frameworks, where multiple parallel and/or hierarchical agents work in a collaborative manner to achieve better performance than a single, general agent.\"\r",

      "Transformer Uncertainty Estimation with Hierarchical Stochastic Attention\tInvited Talk\tsea2022\tSearch Engine Amsterdam (SEA)\t29/04/2022\t\"Amsterdam, Netherlands\"\t\t\"In this talk, I introduce the stochastic transformers, which have been published at AAAI 2022 conference and discuss about uncertain estimation in NLP/IR.Transformers are state-of-the-art in a wide range of NLP tasks and have also been applied to many real-world products. Understanding the reliability and certainty of transformer model predictions is crucial for building trustable machine learning applications, e.g., medical diagnosis. Although many recent transformer extensions have been proposed, the study of the uncertainty estimation of transformer models is under-explored.
