Multimodal Conversational AI Agents Towards Smarter Assistant	Invited Talk	msr2024	Microsoft Research	07/02/2024	"Cambridge, United Kingdom"		"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is playing an increasingly vital role in scientific research, particularly in enhancing Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) through the development of smarter agents. Conversational AI agents, in particular, have demonstrated considerable potential in enriching the user experience within multimodal immersive systems, facilitated by large language model (LLM)-powered autonomous agents. 

In this talk, drawing from my practical expertise, we will delve into the application of large foundation models and frameworks in natural language processing (NLP) and information retrieval (IR) tasks. Specifically, we will explore recent advancements in multimodal agents within Extended Reality (XR) environments utilizing LLMs such as OpenAI's GPT models, LLAMA2, etc. We will also discuss model fine-tuning techniques like LORA and QLORA, as well as agent planning methodologies grounded in prompting techniques such as Chain of Thought and ReACT. 

Furthermore, we will address the revision of the frontier research and the potential for fostering interdisciplinary collaborations between researchers and practitioners in the realms of NLP and HCI. Moreover, we will discuss the challenges and limitations in multimodal XR scenarios, aiming to provide insights into overcoming these obstacles effectively."

Generative AI towards Scientific Discovery	Invited Talk	msr2023	Microsoft Research AI4Science	06/04/2023	"Amsterdam, Netherlands"		"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is becoming increasingly important for scientific research, with many applications in fields like chemistry and biology. Generative AI, in particular, has shown great promise in accelerating scientific discovery by generating hypotheses and insights that may be difficult for humans to uncover. In this talk, we will use my previous research as examples to explore how generative AI models can be applied to natural language processing (NLP) and information retrieval (IR) tasks. We will also discuss the challenges and limitations of using generative AI, including concerns around uncertainty and interpretability. Furthermore, we will discuss the potential applications of generative AI in scientific discovery, such as accelerating the discovery of new molecules and simulating biological processes. Generative AI also has the potential to facilitate interdisciplinary collaborations between AI researchers and domain experts, such as chemists and biologists."
Learning Embeddings to Represent Information Retrieval Systems	Invited Conference Talk	amlc2022	Amazon Machine Learning Conference (AMLC)	14/10/2022	"Seattle, WA, US"		"In this talk, I introduce our paper accepted by Amazon Machine Learning Conference (AMLC) 2022 Workshop on Deep Metric Learning and Semantic Similarity Search."
Frontiers of Collaborative Task-oriented Dialogue Systems	Invited Talk	ucl2022	University College London (UCL)	06/07/2022	"London, UK"		"In this talk, I introduce our exploration of collaborative dialogue models and our recent work on task-oriented dialogue systems. Task-oriented dialogue systems (TDSs), as an important branch of dialogue systems, have raised considerable interest due to their broad applicability. Recent end-to-end single-module TDSs have many attractive characteristics, e.g., global optimization and easy adaptation to new domains. However, we think it is impractical to use a single general agent to handle all complex cases in TDSs. For example, an agent that is specialized in booking a restaurant is unlikely to work well in scheduling meetings. Inspired by this intuition, we call for studies on a new series of collaborative task-oriented dialogue system (CTDS) frameworks, where multiple parallel and/or hierarchical agents work in a collaborative manner to achieve better performance than a single, general agent."
Transformer Uncertainty Estimation with Hierarchical Stochastic Attention	Invited Talk	sea2022	Search Engine Amsterdam (SEA)	29/04/2022	"Amsterdam, Netherlands"		"In this talk, I introduce the stochastic transformers, which have been published at AAAI 2022 conference and discuss about uncertain estimation in NLP/IR.Transformers are state-of-the-art in a wide range of NLP tasks and have also been applied to many real-world products. Understanding the reliability and certainty of transformer model predictions is crucial for building trustable machine learning applications, e.g., medical diagnosis. Although many recent transformer extensions have been proposed, the study of the uncertainty estimation of transformer models is under-explored.
