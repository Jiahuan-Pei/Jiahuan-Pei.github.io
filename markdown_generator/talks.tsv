Frontiers of Collaborative Task-oriented Dialogue Systems	Invited Talk	ucl2022	University College London (UCL)	2022-07-06	London, UK		In this talk, I introduce our exploration of collaborative dialogue models and our recent work on task-oriented dialogue systems. Task-oriented dialogue systems (TDSs), as an important branch of dialogue systems, have raised considerable interest due to their broad applicability. Recent end-to-end single-module TDSs have many attractive characteristics, e.g., global optimization and easy adaptation to new domains. However, we think it is impractical to use a single general agent to handle all complex cases in TDSs. For example, an agent that is specialized in booking a restaurant is unlikely to work well in scheduling meetings. Inspired by this intuition, we call for studies on a new series of collaborative task-oriented dialogue system (CTDS) frameworks, where multiple parallel and/or hierarchical agents work in a collaborative manner to achieve better performance than a single, general agent.
Learning Embeddings to Represent Information Retrieval Systems	Conference proceedings Talk	amlc2022	Amazon Machine Learning Conference (AMLC)	2022-10-14	Seattle, WA, US		In this talk, I introduce our paper accepted by Amazon Machine Learning Conference (AMLC) 2022 Workshop on Deep Metric Learning and Semantic Similarity Search.
Transformer Uncertainty Estimation with Hierarchical Stochastic Attention	Invited Talk	sea2022	Search Engine Amsterdam (SEA)	2022-04-29	Amsterdam, Netherlands		In this talk, I will introduce the stochastic transformers, which have been published at AAAI 2022 conference and discuss about uncertain estimation in NLP/IR.Transformers are state-of-the-art in a wide range of NLP tasks and have also been applied to many real-world products. Understanding the reliability and certainty of transformer model predictions is crucial for building trustable machine learning applications, e.g., medical diagnosis. Although many recent transformer extensions have been proposed, the study of the uncertainty estimation of transformer models is under-explored.
